All JavaScript code is linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`

  * Use kebab-case for class names
  * Use variables for colors, spacing, and other design tokens
  * Group related styles together
  * Add comments for complex style blocks

## Project Structure
