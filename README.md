## 🚢 Deployment

This application can be deployed on Vercel, Netlify, or any other platform that supports Next.js:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel or Netlify
3. Configure your environment variables
4. Deploy!

### Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

If you encounter dependency errors during deployment like:
- `Can't resolve '@auth/prisma-adapter'`
- `Can't resolve 'jsonwebtoken'`
- `Can't resolve 'socket.io'`

These issues occur because the packages are missing from your dependencies. Fix them by:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @auth/prisma-adapter jsonwebtoken socket.io socket.io-client
   ```
   
2. Install TypeScript types for development:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/jsonwebtoken @types/bcrypt
   ```

3. Make sure the Prisma client is initialized correctly in `src/lib/prisma.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
   
   const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };
   
   export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma || new PrismaClient();
   
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
   
   export default prisma;
   ```

4. Run Prisma generate before deploying:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

5. Ensure your `package.json` postinstall script includes Prisma generate:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "postinstall": "prisma generate"
   }
   ```

## 🔒 Authentication

The application uses a custom JWT authentication system with the following features:
- Email and password authentication
- Remember me functionality
- Password reset via email
- Role-based authorization (Job Seeker, Company, Admin)
- Protected routes on both client and server

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with optimized views for:
- Mobile devices (< 640px)
- Tablets (640px - 1024px)
- Desktops (> 1024px)

## 🌙 Dark Mode

Toggle between light and dark themes based on user preference or system settings.
